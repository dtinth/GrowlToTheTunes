GrowlToTheTunes : an alternative for GrowlTunes
===============================================

When I upgraded to Mountain Lion, I found out that the hidden dock feature that shows
the playing iTunes track is now removed.

So an alternative is to use [**GrowlTunes**](http://growl.info/extras.php#GrowlTunes).

But my internet connection is very slow, so I think it's faster to code one myself. Here is it.

To run,

    ./growl-to-the-tunes
